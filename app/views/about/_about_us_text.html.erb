<p>Dear fellow renters and home owners,</p>

<p>I grew up with a lot of brothers and sisters. Our house was a noisy and chaotic place, and rarely did we sit down as an entire family (there were 8 of us) to enjoy a meal. Between science projects, swimming practice, band practice, musical rehearsals&#8230; parents and kids were always coming and going.</p>

<p>I bet you know that overwhelming, when-will-life-slow-down feeling.</p>

<p>In the middle of all that chaos, my mom had a way to remind us of what was important, and where we could always go for help. She had a saying that she repeated to us over and over:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Our home is a haven&#8221;</em></p>

<p>What she meant was:</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>When life gets rough or if you have a bad day, you can always come back to a safe, clean home. You can rest and relax and recalibrate here, away from the demands and hurry of the rest of the world. This place is safe. This place is home</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she tried really hard to live up to that ideal.</p>

<p>*Pause*</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turns out that&#8217;s <strong>really</strong> hard to do.</p>

<p>Between my parents both working full time and a full schedule for each of my siblings, our house wasn&#8217;t always the cleanest place. Many times it was just a plain disaster.</p>

<p>But in our defense, how do you find the time to make sure your entire home is swept, trashes emptied, blinds dusted, carpets vaccumed, dishes cleaned/dried/put away, fans dusted, toilet scrubbed, bathtub scrubbed, mirrors wiped down, and the list goes on&#8230; </p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t enough time in the day. </p>

<p>So we&#8217;re here to help.</p>
